  <h3> &#8658 BUSINESS AND INTUITION</h3> 

<p><b>Business and intuition:</b> there seems little or no connection between the two words but through this article, readers will be convinced that the essence of success lies in the combination of these two words.</p>
<p>Intuition means understanding on the basis of one’s inner self rather than facts, also known as ‘gut feeling.’ When we dig more into intuition we come to know that where our sense of knowledge ends, intuition begins from there. Joybell said and I quote, ‘Our bodies have five senses but not to be overlooked are the senses of our souls: intuition, peace, foresight, trust and empathy.’</p> 
<p>In science it won’t be wrong if we say that knowledge has greater role because everything needs to be proved on grounds of facts before becoming the law but in business intuition plays a greater role. Intuition lets us to be creative and imaginative in the crowd of external information. Often we ignore our foresight, which doesn’t show the outcomes soon but in the long run they do. What we foresee can be equivalent to a vision and vision if communicated and implemented in reality will earn laurels of success for sure as Steve Jobs, a visionary leader said, ‘Intuition is more powerful than intellect.’ Albert Einstein called it the sacred gift.</p>
<p>Let’s be practical and talk about some examples from the life of entrepreneurs. Donald Trump, ignoring his personal life, is a lead business tycoon and according to him he has built the multi-billion empire by using his intuition. Aileen Mahoney- Evotive marketing-also considers intuition to be a great player in business.</p> 
<p>By following one’s intuitions and making decisions even if one fails, he/she will not regret over it because they did something which was soully theirs without the intervention of others.</p>
<p>Here are a few ways business could become ‘brilliant’ from ‘average’ if we give a chance to our intuitions:</p>
<h4>1) Follow your vision:</h4> 
<p>Do not just keep gut feeling in your guts. Try your best to turn it into reality. Think, model, communicate and build. Visions have always ended up in achieving something exemplary. </p>
<h4>2) Self Confidence: </h4>
<p>There is a thin line between being confident and being over confident. Once you have decided to follow your intuitions, trust them. Remember the best version of your business is you yourself.</p>


<h4>3) Motivation: </h4>
<p>Decisions taken on the influence of others and decisions taken by our own thinking have different levels of motivation. The former renders us intrinsically motivated while the latter leaves us externally motivated which is short lived and will soon bore us in our business life. </p>
<h4>4) Trend Setters: </h4>
<p>Intuition is natural intelligence. By using the most of it or by thinking out of the box one can reinvent the business. It can be on the path of doing something which is not being done by others. So a trend is set, a trend begins. </p>
<h4>5) Emerging leaders:</h4>
<p>Intuitive business leaders know they are just the part of a whole thing. Each member of their team matters equally so they provide ample opportunities to their team members to develop. They coach, communicate, and motivate them towards their vision which results in the form of a satisfied and active team working towards a goal.</p>
<p>Intuition has its role not only in business but in life as well. If not yet used this magical potion, search, start consuming and reap its enormous benefits because intuition is present in everyone. The need is to realize; the need is to use it.</p>

  <h3>&#8658 YOUR CGPA DOES NOT MATTER </h3> 

  <p>I have been longing to write on this topic for quite some time: <b>‘Your cgpa does not matter’</b>under the domain of how social media is shaping our minds, perceptions, opinions daily.</p>
  <p>I remember that lately PSL anthem for 4th season by Fawad Khan came out and the entire facebook was filled with bad and disappointing remarks for the song. Without listening the song, I also followed the suit and grew up in favour of supporting the crowd. But when I listened to it, it wasn’t that ‘bad’ as portrayed by different people and posts. It has a good composition, a merry tune, an excited singer, yes there are some cons of including the rapper but overall I could rate it at 4 star. Obviously, the benchmark set by the well-groomed Ali Zafar is difficult to reach but coming up with criticism all the time is not desirable too. In short, we form our opinions even before experiencing and I am not different either. Similarly there are a lot many other posts through which people form their opinions and perceptions and one such is ‘CGPA’, Cumulative Grade Point Average.</p> 
  <p>No doubt, Pakistan is exploding with competition nowadays. There’s a race going on. I have seen posts on different social networking sites which I am sharing here too:</p> 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  <p>I meant to say that these posts could be offensive. If you say ‘cgpa’ matters by portraying a black man marrying a beautiful girl, that could be offensive towards people scoring good cgpa’s because it’s not always people whose looks are average score a ‘4’ cgpa or vice versa. There are also many other posts that if you have a cgpa above 3 then you are superior to ones scoring below 3 or 2 or even failing. My point here is to admit that our humour has become offensive and biased nowadays. We don’t know and fights erupt on this. It’s my personal experience to see the post of a ‘xyz’ girl on Facebook in which she claimed that people who have 4 gpa does not have a life. They do not have extra-curricular, or talents or fun in their lives. May be, I’m not defying her stance, there could be some people in our society who score exceptionally do not have lives but stereotyping other people is not justified. Making this perception about every other single high scorer you meet and proclaiming is humiliating.</p> 
  <p><b>Yes! your ‘cgpa’ does not define you.</b> It does not define your talents, skills and hidden innovation or expertise but it’s not the either way too. It’s also not that your cgpa does not matter at all. We all are practical and we know that eligibility criteria on the basis of cgpa is there at most of the firms. Quora ranks GPA 50 out of the scale 100 in terms of the placement of the person. We should come out of this war of stereotyping or dividing people on the basis of their ‘cgpa’. CGPA is just an element in the platter of a person’s life and there are many other elements too. No one could be compared to other because we all have different conditions of life.  Also famous failures such as Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey and others are not born day in and day out.</p> 
  <p>The real purpose of these social networking sites is to socialize i.e, share things and remain in touch with your friends, family members, relatives, others. Share stuff that does not humiliate or mock others. In history, the causes of wars have always been either betrayal by loyal persons of the rulers/Kings or fights and passing of scornful remarks on small issues. I wonder if social media is serving the same cause today for the modern 3rd world war. Well, I am really hoping that my anticipation is wrong.</p> 
  <p>In summation, we should be well-observant ourselves in forming our own opinions or perceptions based on our own judgements and not on the basis of these <b>‘stupid’</b>  posts. Also we should always use these social networking sites for a good cause and not for making enemies or disdaining others. Until the next time, be happy and make others happy. TC.</p>

   <h3>&#8658 WOMEN’S DAY SPECIAL</h3>
  <p><b>“No nation can rise up to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you.”</b> I repeat Quaid’s words again<b> “No nation can rise up to the height of glory unless your women are side by side with you.”</b></p>
  <p>We see all rounders in cricket; We see all rounder students, you see good at both studies and extra curricular, but I see an all rounder in this living life, a working woman. May be my words become insufficient to salute the exceptional roles played by all working women but my words will leave an impact hopefully. The life of a working woman is like an hour glass. There are two phases one is personal and the other is professional. They run round the clock starting from early in the morning preparing breakfast in the morning for their kids if not kids then husbands, other daily chores such as “Abbu aaj maid ko yeh kehna hai.. khaana banadiya hai.. Kids will come early give them food on time..” Then she devotes atleast 6 hours to work. Struggling professionally listening to superiors’ harsh words sometimes.. returning back home.. Tired.. Exhausted.. Sleepy. A working woman’s life is like a car which is running on a road with no brakes with the destiny to keep the people in car happy and satisfied throughout the journey not to even bump with other cars. Maintain cordial relations with outsiders too. Then she has to give time to kids. Time to husband. In short time to family. In all this, where is she herself? What about all her own wishes and desires of traveling and leisure? What about her own health? Women’s day is not something to celebrate being a women. It’s about taking a moment and acknowledging the phenomenal performances and achievements being performed by women day in and day out not just derogating them. The society will literally stop working today if there are no women side by side working with men. It’s a day to value their efforts though it should be everyday but still it’s a day to recognize women and their worth in our lives, in this society and moreover in this world.</p>
  <p>Feel special, unique and top of the world today. HAPPY WOMEN’S DAY</p>
